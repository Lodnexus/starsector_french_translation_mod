"urbanized_polity","Urbanized Polity","A dense and cosmopolitan center of population, people of all walks of life live, work, and die in the stacked hab-complexes, commercial concourses, and modular workshops."
"industrial_polity","Industrial Polity","A bustling industrial center. The policies of the local government encourage thriving industry, at the expense of all other concerns."
"rural_polity","Rural Polity","A sparsely populated polity of homesteads and insular townships. In these troubled times, outsiders are generally treated with suspicion."
"large_refugee_population","Large Refugee Population","Desperate refugees fleeing some disaster have ended up here. Refugees live at the bottom of society with little opportunity for betterment, straining domestic infrastructure living in tense semi-legal status. Reduced overall production. More prospective crew members are likely to be found among those trying to escape the squalid living conditions."
"volturnian_lobster_pens","Volturnian Lobster Pens","A mix of several Old Earth species and a little imagination produced this creature which grows wild in the crushing depths of Volturn's sea-floor. The flavor is said to be exceptional."
"vice_demand","Vice Demand","The demand for vice goods is unusually high here."
"organized_crime","Organized Crime","Criminal activity produces drugs and harvested organs. Increases demand for hand weapons (by both various crime bosses and local citizenry) and marines (by the local authorities)."
"frontier","Frontier","Far from the cosmopolitan centers of population, mere survival, self-reliance, and only-the-necessities are the rules of the frontier. Increased demand for weapons and supplies, reduced demand for luxury goods."
"shipbreaking_center","Shipbreaking Center","A major center of shipbreaking in this region of the Sector, hulks are consigned to scrapping here by the navies of major factions and many other clients from among the Sector core worlds."
"trade_center","Trade Center","A major center of trade, merchant vessels from across the Sector dock here expecting to find a buyer for their goods- and to find something to buy in turn for a nice profit."
"decivilized","Decivilized","There is no stable ruling polity here. Civilization is collapsed and current population is effectively unknown, though groups of survivors, bandits, and looters can be detected."
"decivilized_subpop","Decivilized Subpopulation","Civilization has been brought back to parts of $market, often at the point of a gauss rifle. However, an effectively unknown population of survivors, bandits, and looters still remains on the fringes."

Immigration controls are likewise relaxed, resulting in a greater in-flow of people, albeit sometimes of a more questionable character. This may cause other factions to view this colony with distrust."
"closed_immigration","Closed Immigration","Officially, immigration to $market is not allowed. In practice, this results in slowing overall immigration significantly, and creating room for certain kinds of criminals to operate."

"twilight","Twilight World","Tidally locked to its primary, or near enough, $market is a terraformed world with days the length of seasons. Day/night temperature variation is accordingly harsh even to engineered terran life. Islands of 'civilized' mild biomes are maintained through judicious use of solar shades and mirrors. "
"tundra","Tundra World","Terraforming has brought terran life to $market but the world remains as cold as the deepest of Earth's ice ages. Though millions of square kilometers are covered in glacier, there are also taiga provinces and rolling steppe where warmer conditions prevail."
"cryovolcanic","Cryovolcanic World","A world frozen beyond deepest chill, methane snow falls on mountains of water-ice and volcanos erupt with ammonia. Stellar radiation breaks down the volatiles to form an atmosphere of light gases such as nitrogen and oxygen while hydrogen is whisked into space. "

"extreme_tectonic_activity","Extreme Tectonic Activtity","$market's crust roils chaotically with extreme quakes and cataclysmic volcanism events. Any operations will require exceptional care and use of many-times redundant warning systems so that the worst dangers can be avoided.
